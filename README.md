# Anki Deck Generator from Webpage Glossary

Creating Anki flashcards can be a tedious and time-consuming process, especially when you have a large glossary or list of terms and definitions from a webpage that you want to convert into flashcards. 📚 

The Anki Deck Generator is a Python script that uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch and parse the HTML content of a specified webpage. The script then extracts the glossary entries (terms and definitions) from the HTML, ensuring proper pairing even if the HTML structure has missing or extra elements.

Once the terms and definitions are extracted and paired, the script generates an Anki deck in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format. Each line in the TSV file represents a flashcard, with the term and definition separated by a tab character. This TSV file can be easily imported into Anki, creating a ready-to-use deck for study.
